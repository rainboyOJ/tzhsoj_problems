## 描述

One of the first users of BIT's new supercomputer was Chip Diller. He extended his exploration of powers of 3 to go from 0 to 333 and he explored taking various sums of those numbers. ``This supercomputer is great,'' remarked Chip. ``I only wish Timothy were here to see these results.'' (Chip moved to a new apartment, once one became available on the third floor of the Lemon Sky apartments on Third Street.) 

## 输入格式

The input will consist of at most 100 lines of text, each of which contains a single VeryLongInteger. Each VeryLongInteger will be 100 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no VeryLongInteger will be negative). The final input line will contain a single zero on a line by itself. 

## 输出格式

Your program should output the sum of the VeryLongIntegers given in the input.
